# [Seven Tech Startups To Watch Out For In 2022](https://tech.co/news/top-tech-companies-2022)

I found this article interesting as it well summarizes 7 inspiring tech startups in 2022. With an universal aim to "make the world a more streamlined, affordable, and equal place,” the companies listed each suggests their innovative ideas. 

Among the 7 companies, I found Grifin the most interesting. Grifin is one of the three fin-tech companies listed. It is an investment app that automatically let users invest into a business they spent money on. For example, “if a user spends $3.95 at a Starbucks, a dollar of their money will go into Starbucks stock, meaning they spend $4.95 in total.” I was personally amazed by such approach as this definitely makes ‘investment’ more approachable and do-able.

**Geon Tack** Grifin seems to be an interesting app! It kind of of "forces" you to invest, but I think it will be a great start for investing for beginners.
